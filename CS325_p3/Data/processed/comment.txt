Most states have <100 people in them.

CO and WY have 0 towns and 0 roads combined.
Like, other than hardcore 4WD tourists, the population of those areas is nil

WY covers Uluṟu and the town of Yulara, which has over 1100 population, and an airport. I wouldn’t say 0 towns and roads. It’s Not flooding with them but still a few there

Yulara might be a little to the east of WY.

So just like the real Wyoming?

I mean less than a million people so close enough

r/wyomingdoesntexist

That's not true. They are dotted with small towns

Half are abandoned or mining towns so only populated half thr year

So Australia is full of ghost towns and mining only operates only 6 months of the year...?

There's a lot of old mining/cattle towns that don't exist anymore for one reason or another, mostly mines dried up or due to changes in how cattle ranches work the outposts aren't needed anymore. We went on a trip out in qld along the adventure way, and we had one of those hema maps and a lot of little spots labelled abandoned. Lots of old waystation towns or routes that aren't used anymore. 
On the seasonal mines, it's mostly the gemstones. We stopped at Yowah, and as we went there in the off-season, there were like 5 people there, but we were talking with the owner of a jem shop. The workers only come in the winter, because the jem buyers from Europe and the like come out once a year and buy a whole load in bulk so there isn't the need to have it going all year like a metal/coal mine. 
Not an expert just my anecdote on a shitpost. Once you go about an hour inland from the coast it gets empty fast here

Yep. Biggests states would be alabama, virginia, maryland, conneticut, calafornia then texas

Brisbane is at the top of New Jersey and into Rhode Island, not Connecticut

Alabama would never be Melbourne

I agree. These are just purely based off equivalent locations when you compare america and australia, nothing more.

But 2 senators. Just like America!

Do emus live there? They’d be as smart as some of our 90 year old senators.

America is no different lol

American states have a population minimum to become states.

I feel like the states should be reversed north south wise to fit into climate better

Yeah i could give that a shot to. The main goal was to just recreate the locations and approximate borders directly onto the map of Australia, similar to another post that was made on this sub where they put australian states directly onto america. It wasnt my initial intention to match climates together. If i did that far north queensland would make a great florida.

Queensland is called the sunshine state.

I thought the same, but in general the top & bottom of each country dont really match latitudes, do they?  Like the southern tip of Florida is barely tropical, whereas the northern tip of Queensland is well into the tropics...

WA (Washington) falls totally within WA (Western Aus) :-)

Very convenient indeed

this is so terrible i love it

My home state of Tasmania is now Florida.... This tracks.

Tasmania now gets hit repeatedly with hurricanes along with people and buildings getting swallowed by random sinkholes now being a thing.

I mean Burnie did have that small hurricane a few years back (it damaged one building in round hill, and threw the roof up the hill). & I think the joke might have gone over my head but mole creek has lost a building or two before to sink holes.

Oh Man. Now that's something we don't hear on the other end of the Pacific. So it's already Florida over there then.

Don’t ever fucking do this to us again

Could have made the Australian Antarctic Territory Alaska.

So New Zealand is Cuba? That tracks.

The Gold Coast... of New Jersey.
Legit.

The Gold Coast is Australia’s Jersey Shore

I wish real Florida was disconnected from the mainland.

Apparently people for generations want the same thing as you: https://youtu.be/2IDwpTABJG4?si=zhAOGRNYMkGZa4YE

Let's make it happen then.

australians, what is your new state now?

State of emergency

For me it looks like i will be in tennesse, just at the border of alabama

Virginia or Maryland

Alabama

NJ, which I'm assuming is New Jersey?

Yep. Looks as if NJ is Brisbane/Gold Coast.

Yeah. That's me.

Alabama 🙄

New york

Virginia

California. Oh no.

Virginia

alabama

The corner of four.

Id be almost exactly on the five state intersection of Alabama NC SC etc

Sand Land, which is wayyy better than Sandy Outback. 
Remember, when you move to Sand Land from Sandy Outback, leave your sandy voting behind, because we do sand without a Y here.

Cool - I live on Hawaii 🏝️

Adelaide … we have a problem

As someone from Louisville thank you for sending Indiana so far away.

You take the panhandle off CO right now 😡

No i dont think i will.

Look at the cute little Texas

Texas ain’t gonna like this

Tropical NH? No thanks.

Nice work

Thanks :)

Should have accounted for the southern hemisphere being colder as one travels south.   Or maybe I like Tasmania too much to call it Florida. They are both unique places in their own countries, but not in the same way.

Yeah i could give that a shot to. The main goal was to just recreate the locations and approximate borders directly onto the map of Australia, similar to another post that was made on this sub where thry put australian states directly onto america. It wasnt my initial intention to match climates together. If i did that far north queensland would make a great florida.

Massachusetts not being the coast seems criminal

Landlocked by New York no less. This map is violence.

MA has a longer coast then NY IRL, but got no coast here

MA has a longer
Coast then NY IRL,
But got no coast here

Tiny Texas, LMAO

Vermont bordering Michigan is interesting.

I live in Alabama now. Not sure if I like that.

As someone who lives in the southeast of South Australia and wishes we had humid weather, this really needs to be flipped upside down lol.

Yeah. I am thinking about doimg an alternative one which is flipped to accomodate the climate. But decided to just put the states in based on similar location when you look at the two maps. The intention wasnt to base the states on climate.

Apparently I live In Pennsylvania now?

There is a Victoria, TX

I love how LA looks like LA and TX looks
Like MD, lol

I love Tasmania as Florida!! 🤣

I will never forgive you for putting me in New Jersey

And new Zealand will be like Cuba??

Does Australia have Tasmanian Man news stories?

I hear they are real devils

With most states having population of 15 to 20 people. Lol

What's for AK and HI?

Christmas Island and Kangaroo Island

You get a bunch of sand! You get a bunch of sand! You get a bunch of sand!
YOU ALL GET A BUNCH OF SAND! The spiders too!!

MA doesn’t even get a coast 🙄

There isnt enough coast for everyone lol

It would have to flip so Maine is farthest from the equator

Tasmania as Florida, gotta laugh (and then have a cry, because it’s true).

I'm soooo sorry Tasmania. No one deserves that sort of slander.

Yes they do. They should be lucky i didnt call them alabama.

Massachusetts not being on the coast is a travesty …how are the Pilgrims gonna land there?

what island is representing hawai'i

Kangaroo island

What is Alaska?

Christmas island

Everyone asks what is alaska, but never how is alaska.

Very true.

Never how baked Alaska tastes!!

Ironic. Since Christmas Island is about the size of one of Alaska's Aleutian Islands.😂😂

Christmas island. Couldnt think of anything else for that one tbh

Please god no

Not enough squares.

Wyoming cant be anything other than a square

Florida and Alabama should get swapped, Tassie has the incest of Alabama, and Melborne has as much meth as florida

It would have worked a lot better if you flipped it around

This is so upsetting on so many levels istg

I love the state of Kaasas, abbreviated KA

My bad i used the wrong abbreviation. Im not american but tbh KA makes more sense than KN.

It’s actually KS, but I get your point

why is MA landlocked lol

except they would have to be as stupid as we are and give the states with almost no people extra status in electing the chief executive.  Oh, and also having the states with no people have equal weight in one house of their legislature.

Massachusetts being landlocked while Vermont has a coastline is bugging me more than it probably should.

Ew why is California so distorted lmao

Aw man, I thought it was quite similar to actual california.

It's quite similar, but the shape was completely inflated at the bottom  
lol

Yeah fair enough. In my defense i didnt spend a great deal of time on it. Dont even know why i bothered doing this at all lol.

Yeaaah x)

r/imaginarymaps this is for real stuff

There is a meme/humor flair on this sub so i think this is fine. Plus there was another post here for the opposite. If this isnt allowed then let the mods take it down.

This should be in r/imaginarymaps, not here

Well there is a meme flair for this sub
And there are other similar posts here, so i think it would be allowed here

You gonna do the opposite?  America if it was divided like Australia?

That has already been done on this sub. That was the inspiration for this one

Oh boy Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire residents would get a shock to the system living up there

California keeps its climate in its new location

Would VA be the most populous state then?

That or alabama. Not too sure

Legit question from an American.
What you indicated as VT and ME I was always told have the worst or the worst of poisonous animals and salties. That would be more like Florida than Maine or Vermont!

I feel like this map is unfair to Tasmania.  No one wants to be Florida, except Floridians

Is that Kangaroo Island that’s Hawaii?

Yep. Couldnt think of anything better tbh.
